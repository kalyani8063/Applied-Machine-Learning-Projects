About This Repository

This repository contains small-scale machine learning exercises and mini-projects completed during my ML coursework. The goal is to understand and practice core ML concepts such as data preprocessing, EDA, and basic model building.

Skills Practiced

Data cleaning using Pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and scaling

Implementing basic ML models using Scikit-learn

Model evaluation techniques

Purpose

To build strong foundational understanding of machine learning workflows through practical experimentation.
